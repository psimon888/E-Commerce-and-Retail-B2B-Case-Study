Problem Statement

Schuster, a global retail company specializing in sports goods and accessories, manages business relationships with hundreds of vendors through credit arrangements. Unfortunately, many vendors do not adhere to agreed-upon credit terms and often make late payments. Although Schuster imposes substantial late payment fees, this approach is not conducive to maintaining long-term business relationships. Additionally, employees spend significant time following up on overdue payments, leading to non-value-added activities, wasted time, and financial implications. To improve efficiency, Schuster aims to understand its vendors’ payment behaviors and predict the likelihood of late payments on outstanding invoices.

Payment Process at Schuster

For every transaction with a vendor, Schuster’s accounting team issues an invoice and sends it to the vendor. This invoice includes the details of the goods, the total invoice value, the date of issuance, and the payment due date based on the credit terms outlined in the contract. Given the frequency of business interactions, vendors typically have multiple open invoices at any given time.

Business Objectives

Segment vendors to gain insights into their payment behaviors.
Use historical data to predict the likelihood of delayed payments for upcoming invoices with future due dates.
Utilize these predictions to optimize resource allocation, accelerate credit recovery, and reduce non-value-added activities.
